This matlab algorithm is for naive gauss elimation to solve systems of equations. Solves the system Ax = b using the elimination, A must be a square matrix. Solves the system of equations by eliminating terms and repeating until one variable leff. Then does back substitution to solve for the rest of the variables.

## Inputs: ##

A is an n x n matrix

b is an n x 1 vector

## Output: ##

x - array of the soltutions to system of euations
