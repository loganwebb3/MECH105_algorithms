This matlab algorith is for LU decompostion which is a method of decomposing a square matrix into two triangular matrices. The method is commonly used in numerical analysis and linear algebra for solving systems of linear equations, matrix inversion, and computing determinants.

## Inputs: ##

A - coefficient matrix

## Outputs: ##

L - lower triangular matrix, with 1's along the diagonals (values of the matrix are the coefficents used to eliminate values of matrix when making matricies)

U - upper triangular matrix (matrix with upper right triangle of it is full of values and the rest 0s)

P - the pivot matrix (tells how the order of the original matrix was changed)
