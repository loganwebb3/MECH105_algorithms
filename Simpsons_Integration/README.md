This matlab algorithm is for numerical integation using the simpsons 1/3 rule. It also uses a trapiziodal rule for estimation of the integral for the last values if the number of intervals in input matricies is odd. Input arrays must be equally spaced. Useful to integrate tables or functions that are not easily integrate anayltically. Will give a warning when the trapaziodal rule was used.

## Inputs: ##

x - array of x values

y - array of y values

## Output: ##

I - value of estimated intergal.
