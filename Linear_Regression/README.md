This matlab algorithm is for linear regression that creates a line of best fit for the date points given.

Inputs: 
x - x values of the data set
y - y values of the data set

Outputs:
fx - Filtered x-values (i.e. the input x-values but without the outlier points), sorted from smallest to largest
fy - Filtered y-valeus (i.e. the input y-values but without the outlier points), sorted from smallest to largest
Slope - slope from the linear regression line
Intercept - y intercepts from the linear regression line
Rsquared - Rsquared value
