This matlab algorithm is for linear regression that creates a line of best fit for the date points given. Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It determins the best possible best fit line to minimize the distance from all the points to that line.

## Inputs: ##

x - x values of the data set

y - y values of the data set

## Outputs: ##

fx - Filtered x-values (i.e. the input x-values but without the outlier points), sorted from smallest to largest

fy - Filtered y-valeus (i.e. the input y-values but without the outlier points), sorted from smallest to largest

Slope - slope from the linear regression line

Intercept - y intercepts from the linear regression line

Rsquared - Rsquared value which is a statistical measure of how well the regression line approximates the actual data.
